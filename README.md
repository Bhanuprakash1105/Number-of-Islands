# Number-of-Islands
#### Given a boolean 2D matrix, find the number of islands
1. Use the "Question.jpg" image for understanding the question.
2. The programme is written in C++ language, compile the Code.cpp file using g++ compiler (preferred).
3. Compilation command "g++ Code.cpp" and Run using below instructions.
4. If input is a file then use the command "./a.out inputFileName.txt outputFileName.txt".
5. If input is by user interface (terminal) then command "./a.out".
6. Use the "Terminal_screenShot.jpg" image for understanding IO of code with terminal.

#### Time Complexity = O(Rows * Columns)

#### Space Complexity = O(Rows + Columns)
